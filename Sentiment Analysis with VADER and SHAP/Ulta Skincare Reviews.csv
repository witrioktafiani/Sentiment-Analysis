Warming,"I wanted the Multivitamin Power Recovery Masque; but after asking in the store and talking to 2 different people (which took them about 1/2 hr. to ""check,"") was told to order this Multivitamin Thermafoliant instead as they no longer HAVE the other masque. I realized once I got home and checked on-line, this was not the case; but since I had this one coming to me via mail, decided to try it. Dermalogica is a good line; and although this mask did warm my face, considering the hefty price, it's certainly no better than the Biore 6 individually contained masks in foil packets which I've used in the past.

My new Holy Grail scrub!,"Dermalogica's products have always been a hit or miss for me but I'm glad to say that this product is one of the exceptions! Is the few seconds 'warming' sensation when you apply this a bit gimmicky? I used to think so at first, but as I've continued to use it, I'm starting to think this is the one quality that sets this one apart from so many other great exfoliators I've tried, heat helping to open up pores and all that. And of course the ingredients working in these open pores have to be the part too and these definitely are...Retinol, AHA's, BHA's and some good botanicals. The exfoliating granules are finely milled, the Licorice and Vitamin C (combined with the acids) give a fantastic brightening effect, and most importantly my skin feels perfectly smooth afterwards. I love how you're always in control with the amount of exfoliation, on dry skin it works most intensely, but add water if you wish to make it less intense, and the more water you add, the less it will be. Just over 1 minute of gently working this into my skin and I'm done, and I only use a small amount, you don't need lots as you do with so many other scrubs. I like the fragrance of this product and despite the oily consistency of it, I find it adds a bit of hydration into my skin which sometimes (being oily/combination) is just about all the hydration I need. There is a slight residue, but once I've towel dried my face it all but disappears. Pricey yes, but as I mentioned a little goes a long way, so be expecting this to last longer than you expected! -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (My 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

Not only did it help smooth out all the flaking, it has made a huge difference in the brightness of my skin.

From a Picky Skeptic to One Who Tells You to Go Get One,"Alright guys! I'm picky and was tired of getting skin care that was hyped up and overpriced. Brand names were charging for their name and drug store products were hit and misses. So back to the review. I went into ULTA with very dry and flaky skin. When I say dry and flaky, the dessert is what you should picture. I had foundation on and you could really see how bad it was. I have combination skin. An oily T-Zone, dry around and on my nose, my chin, and also some on my temples. The rest is normal. I had an amazing girl listen to me and only for that reason I gave Dermalogica a try. I purchased the gel cleanser, this Thermafoliant, and the oil-free face lotion. I though if I didn't like it, I will bring it back. I was diligent to do my part. I started immediately. You guys, by day four, I was blown away! After day four, I put my foundation on, and I saw maybe two little spots of dryness and definitely no flaking. This thermafoliant feels so amazing when you use it. When you put it on your skin with water, it warms up, and it feels like a little spa day for your face. The grit is a perfect size and it does not scratch your face but it does the perfect job of exfoliating your face. With as much dead skin as I had on my face, I cannot believe that I saw such a quick turnaround and I am in my late thirties. I did not use any other products other than the three I've mentioned. It has been around three weeks now and my skin has never looked any better. I know the price is up there but this product will last you for quite a long time. If you're like me and like shopping online, I hope this review helps.

Nice addition to the routine,About a year ago I went into my local Dermalogica story (Scottsdale) and wanted to try a bit of a stronger exfoliant than the Daily Microfoliant (which I love) for my t-zone area to help clear out blackheads a bit more. I first tried the Skin Prep Scrub but that was a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin so then tried this one and it's great. I like to use it once or twice a week and then the Daily Microfoliant on the other days. I find it helps just clear out a bit of the extra congestion in my t-zone area and makes my skin feel super smooth.

This product brings your skin back to life!,"I've been bad of using facial masques until I bought the Multivitamin Thermafoliant at the Dermalogica store in Soho, NY. I use it two times a week, right before the weekend to wash away all the make-up that's been used during the week, and at the end of the weekend, making my skin fresh and ready for a new challenging week. I really see improvement of my skin after using the product and every time I can't wait until next time I can use it.

"A genuine, visible difference - AMAZING product","I am so thankful that my Dermalogica therapist recommended I switch from Daily Microfoliant to the Thermafoliant. I've always believed in exfoliating but wasn't always regular with it as I never really saw that much difference. I started using Thermafoliant a couple of months ago and was immediately taken with how unbelievable my skin felt afterwards - it felt like satin, almost slippery smooth. It also feels really nice with the warming effect. My skin overall is pretty good - I'm 41 but have minimal lines and am usually mistaken for early thirties, for which I credit using Dermalogica for over 10 years now and avoiding the sun. However I had an incredibly aggravating skin tag type thing next to my left eye that really bothered me. It was almost like a wart but skin coloured - maybe 4mm in diameter. It would occasionally flake but if I tried to remove it it was painful and would bleed - gross. My dermatologist told me he could surgically remove it but it might leave a scar so I put it off. However it was bothering me so much I was literally about to make the appointment for surgery when I suddently realised it had COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. No scar, no mark, nothing. It was like it was never there. The Thermafoliant had completely sloughed it off after just a few uses. So this product saved me an expensive dermatologist procedure that would probably have involved stitching and/or slight scarring. I've also had people comment on how good my skin looks at the moment, and that's in the middle of a brutally cold and dry east coast winter. My pores are visibly smaller, and my skin overall is clearer and looks younger. I cannot recommend this product highly enough.

This stuff smells so good...,This stuff smells so lovely... herbal and botanical smelling in a good way. I use this in the shower.

My skin isn't very sensitive and so I can use this often but it is not drying and as long as you rub gently it shouldn't harm your skin. Love it so much.

I will say however though that I am not a huge fan of the scent (although I did see the list of ingredients contains unusual things like mushrooms which aren't exactly known for smelling pleasant lol)-- it reminds me of clay or something like it.. kind of stale. I am torn over whether the bamboo spheres really do much of anything in terms of exfoliation as they don't seem for lack of a better word-- abrasive enough to get the job done? I'm not sure, but overall it doesn't bother me so I don't mind either way. One thing I really like about this product is its moisturizing component. My skin never felt stripped or overly tight and dry after using it, which is a common problem for me and some face wash/exfoliates.

"Lovely, hydrating exfoliant","I really like the Hydro Masque Exfoliant! I had a really hard weed and my skin was looking very rough. It was dull, rough from dry skin, breaking out, and just overall at its worst. This mask helped me lift the dead skin so you can see the clean, supple skin underneath, and it helped brighten and moisturize. I like that it's mostly unscented, although the natural smell reminds me a bit of the lactic acid lotion I use for KP (kind of like the smell of school glue) but it's very mild and the cucumber does help with that aspect of it. The mask helped hydrate my skin (although I still followed it up with hyaluronic acid serum because my skin is always dry and dehydrated) and I finally felt like my skin was super clean, after 5-7 days of being bedridden with an illness. This was a great way to do some self care and feel prettier after a bad week. I will definitely use this in the future!

Best I've Ever Used,"This is by far the best mask I have ever tried. It smells great, it feels amazing when putting it on, and it makes my skin feel so good. I have been using this mask once a week for about 3 weeks now, and I can honestly say, I love it. My skin is so clear and so smooth. I love the packaging of this product too, because it allows you to not overuse and run out of product too quickly. Even though this mask is a bit on the more expensive side, I will be purchasing it once I run out. Dermalogica has become a favorite skin care brand of mine, and I recently brought my husband over to this brand as well.

Fun Masque,"I enjoy doing a weekly facial mask and this was the perfect unique treat for my face! The hydrating bursts remind me of the balls you find in some drinks now and are fun to bust. I don't notice it when I apply it, but when I go to remove the mask, I can feel the exfoliating grains getting rid of dead skin. Overall, it's a fun little me time activity that both exfoliates and hydrates my skin. I will admit though, it has an interesting scent. It smells a little bit like celery (or perhaps some other green vegetable) to me but that doesn't stop me from using it.",No,2 years ago,VA,0,0,Hydro Masque Exfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Hydrating but not greasy,"I've always enjoyed trying dermalogica products, mainly because they are normally out of my price range for something I would buy. I've been eyeing this hydromasque since it launched to help with some of the flakes I get on my face during the winter and transitional seasons. Using it was really easy, and it provided an instant burst of hydration once it was washed off. Now, I didn't find that hydration to be super long lasting, usually about a day or so and then my skin was back to being tight and dry, but that's typically with a wash off mask. The little exfoliating beads were fun, but I don't think they made much of a difference in help smooth and hydrate my skin.

I followed the website URL and got to the page to customize my mask experience. I had a great experience using the facial scanner and timer and I love knowing exactly where I need extra moisture! My skin definitely felt clean and moisturized after this treatment. I don't think it's the most exfoliating, but it's definitely a great mask to add to my collection.

Very Nice but Dispenser Broke,"I really do love this product, but Dermalogica could have put this in a tube and it would have been fine. Or a pump dispenser. I used this product one time, and during my second use, the white press dispenser collapsed and so I had to find a way to get the product out. Luckily, I have a metal tool for scrapping out the last bit of skincare. I had to shove the metal stick right through the collapsed dispenser and use it to push down the plastic bit you can see in the column and dispense product that way. So, although I love this product, as it makes my skin so smooth and soft, I HATE the dispenser. Granted, I now have a work around for using the product. However, for this price point I shouldn't have need one. So, I took 2 stars off just for the sheer frustration I have when using this mask.

Never Giving This Product Up!,"You will have to pry my Daily Superfoliant from my cold dead hands because that's the only reason I'm ever giving it up.

I have been very diligent with my skin care routine, but nothing ever improved the deep scars. After a few weeks of using the Superfoliant I thought I noticed the lumps in my cheeks were smaller. I made my husband and sister feel them to make sure I wasn't crazy. I've been using these products for three months now, and the scars are almost completely gone.

I don't really have issues with blemishes but I do need a good exfoliating product or I notice that my face can look kinda dull or feel dry and scaly, especially in the winter, so this product has been amazing!! It's a little intimidating the first time you use it- you have to wash your face and make sure it's dry, then wet your hands and carefully pour it into one hand (it pours fast so pour slowly) and it does get messy), then rub your hands in a circular motion to make a paste. Once you've got a good consistency just rub it in with your fingers then rinse. I had some left over the first time so I just rubbed the rest on my hands and it helped slough off dry skin I'm prone to get during colder months.

I use it 2x a day and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. I also love the fact that it travels well, no leaks because it's a powder and doesn't turn in to a scrub until you mix with water. Since using the anti aging line of dermoligica I've had so many compliments on how great my skin looks. I watch those youtube videos about product swaps to save some $, don't believe them when they try to tell you some other cheaper brand will give you the same results as dermoligica, they won't.

A Must Have,"I have suffered from acne since middle school leading all the way up to my 20's from blackheads to painful hormonal cystic acne.

From seeing many dermatologist & trying various products, I still could not find a product that seems to consistently work for me.

Amazing!,"I stopped exfoliating a long time ago because it makes my skin produce too much oil so I became afraid and was unsure of what products to use. I was actually recommended this product by the lady who did my eyebrow microblading since she noticed my skin had clogged pores and built up dead skin. I bought this since I trusted her advice and I am so glad I did. I don't use it daily but instead use it in combination a few times a week with my GoodieCo SuperCharged Trio Set. I first use my cleansing oil, then this product, then my brightening and moisturizing oils after and my skin feels AMAZING! I have also learned that finding the right exfoliating product will help your other skincare products work more efficiently. This product specifically has enzymes in it that break down the dead skin cells. I was advised to put this product on and leave for 10 mins then wash instead of washing immediately like the directions state. As with all exfoliating products you should test your skin's sensitivity to a product before you leave it on and don't scrub, be gentle! This product is kind of expensive but if you only use it a few times a week I think you get a pretty good amount for your money. Definitely worth it!",No,3 years ago,"Houston, TX",5,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

It is easy to use. I don't notice a bad scent, so maybe I'll have to update in a few weeks.

Superfoliant made my skin flare up with redness and made it more sensitive for 2 days. I'm glad I tried it, but will be going back to the original microfoliant.

I'm not sure if this is the ""holy grail"" for oily skin, but so far it's been fantastic. THIS IS IN POWDER FORM AND REQUIRES WATER TO ACTIVIATE IT! I didn't see that part until I watched a YouTube review after I'd ordered. If it feels too gritty just add a drop or 2 of water for a smoother texture. I don't have sensitive skin, but have had to skip a day here and there because my nose (sides of nostril area) gets a kind of raw/chapped feeling but that could be from a product combo issue.

Smelled like a full on face of ape s... I mean, I honestly don't think it could come any closer to that smell if it tried. I don't care if my face felt soft after(which is the only reason it got two stars) , there's so many products that can do that and have additional benefits that don't smell so horrendous.

"This is better, this is what I need!","I probably would not have written a review, but I had results right away and was amazed. Every time I get a facial they tell me I haven't been exfoliating enough. I just got a Derma plane a few weeks ago where it seemed like they took off half an inch of skin - this product is very similar to a dermaplane!!! Of course it's not a the actually shaving off of the skin but I mean I left it on for a pretty long time because I got distracted and when I washed it off my skin was tight, and had a new glow to it. My skin feels pretty close to what it was after my derma plan a few weeks ago my skin was very exfoliated. This product REALLY WORKS I have been using the microfolient for years now, but I do not use it often enough to notice any difference. This super folient is like getting an exfoliation facial. I guess I will finish the microfolient I have and try to use it more daily - would hate to waste it - the microfolient can be used daily but this super folient is probably too strong. I would not use it every day, but perhaps I could use it once per week? In winter this could make the skin dry, but definitely in summer this will help. I have skin damage on the top of my forehead. So this completely addressed that. I will probably use this superfolient every 1-2 weeks. I have combination skin.

Lovely Gentle Cleanser,This product is no frills and it does exactly what it says it is going to do. It cleanses your skin without stripping it of the essential moisture it needs. It does not have a scent and the texture is creamy and lush. I love this as my morning cleanser as I don't want to undo all of the hard work from all of my creams and serums from the night before.

"First Dermalogica product I've tried, I love it!","I've actually never heard of Dermalogica before trying the Intensive Moisture Cleanser. So far I love it! I have used so many different products to wash my face, each time I run out of one I seem to buy a new one that I've never tried before. I have touchy skin. I don't usually suffer from breakouts but I have a pretty uneven, sometimes red skin tone, and very dry. Some facial cleansers I've tried give me what I call a ""skin beard"" where I usually wash the hardest, around my mouth and under my nose. Dry flakes of skin, enhanced by foundation! It's awful. I'm so happy so far I haven't experienced that with this cleanser! The cleanser is really creamy feeling. I wear a 24 hour Loreal foundation that even after washing, when I use toner on a cotton pad, makeup still comes off on the pad. I have not had that happen with this cleanser! My face gets completely clean! I do not use a waterproof mascara so I can't speak on how well it removes waterproof mascara, but I do use the cleanser on my eyes and it removes my Wander Mile High Club mascara incredibly well and completely. I have not woken up with raccoon eyes after using this cleanser. It's done wonders for my dry skin, my skin actually feels soft to the touch, something I haven't felt in a while. Definitely feels like a high quality, expensive facial cleanser.

Nice gentle cleanser,"This is a very nice gentle cleanser. It comes out of the bottle in a milky smooth form. It is very very gentle on the face. It feels really good when you are cleansing with it. It washes off smoothly with no residue left. My skin felt very clean afterwards. For most, this is probably enough. But for me, the reason I wanted to try this cleanser is for the intense moisture. While my skin felt wonderful after using it, I had to put moisturizer on right away. After about 30 seconds, my skin was dry again.

I was mild, foamy, hydrating, and left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I tend to get super dry skin if my face wash is too harsh, but this is gentle enough for me to use day AND night and not have an issue with dryness. I know a lot of the complaints were from people saying it didn't hydrate enough BUT you should be using a moisturizer after you wash regardless of what wash your using.

After using this cleanser, my skin felt plump and not dry and tight. I like using this cleanser especially after I have used a peel because it's very mild.

The Perfect Cleanser For Dry Skin!!!,"As someone who struggles with super dry skin and constantly in search of skincare that truly moisturizes and brings my skin back to life, so to speak, finding a cleanser that doesn't strip your skin of the good stuff and dry it out is a tall order! Thankfully, I've now been introduced to Dermalogica's new Intensive Moisture Cleanser and that 'tall order' has just been met, because this cleanser is absolutely wonderful! Although it's great for all skin, it really tackles dry skin beautifully by hydrating and replenishing while it cleans. I'm not entirely sure how Dermalogica accomplished this, but thanks to this ingenious and innovative formula, my skin looks and feels clean, soft & supple, as well as radiant! I only need a small dollop of this rich and creamy cleanser to get a thorough clean each time. In addition to the excellent performance of this skincare product, the science and ingredients that make up this cleanser are just as impressive! This skincare formula does the dirty work of cleaning thoroughly while working simultaneously to protect the lipids and proteins in our skin from being stripped away! That's what makes this skincare cleanser stand apart from other cleansers, in my opinion.

That is until Dermalogica's new Intensive Moisture Cleanser came along! Needless to say...I'll be stocking up on this wonderful skincare product! I also love that this formula is packed with nothing but goodness for your skin from coconut butter to murumuru seed butter and more!

I've been using this cleanser for over a week now and my skin has noticeably improved just in that short period of time. My skin just looks and feels healthier altogether, not to mention very clean....obviously! Another added bonus...a little goes a long way!

Nice gentle cleanser that is non-drying,"I received a sample of this product in exchange for writing a review. I had never heard of Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Cleanser before trying it, but found it to be very high quality. This is a non-foaming, gentle cleanser that does not strip or dry your skin. It has some nice moisturizing ingredients, but I'm not sure how much they help in a rinse-off product. I am deducting one star for fragrance. It contains natural fragrance from a variety of citrus and herbal ingredients, but that doesn't mean people can't be allergic or sensitive to those oils.

"Removes even long stay, waterproof makeup while moisturizing","This cleanser exceeded my expectations. A little goes a very long way! Do not use more than 2 pumps, it will be way too much if you do since the cleanser is potent. I have extremely dry skin so I am constantly looking for the best moisturizing cleansers, serums, lotions and even makeup. The first time that I used this product my first thoughts were how moisturizing it is and how it effectively and efficiently removes makeup without leaving a residue like some cleansers do. I also want to mention that I wear long stay foundation, lipstick and waterproof mascara. dermalogica intensive moisture cleanser works extremely well to quickly and efficiently take it off. Like mentioned before, it only takes at the most 2 pumps. If you use more than 2 pumps it will make your skin greasy. Since using this cleanser I have also found that I do not need to use as much moisturizer or serums since the cleanser itself is so moisturizing. I also want to recommend only using once a day.

Good job at removing makeup,"I have dry skin so I was pretty interested in trying this new Intensive Moisture Cleanser from Dermalogica. When using it, I noticed that it is indeed very moisturizing - the consistency is more like a moisturizer (it's a white cream), and not what you would expect from a cleanser. It has no added fragrances, but it has a herbs/plants scent - not good, not bad, just okay. It did a good job at removing makeup - I used a makeup remover wipe after using this cleanser just in case and it came back practically clean. However, I felt it did dry out my skin a little bit right after using it - which is not exactly a problem, since I applied moisturizer right away and the dryness feeling was gone.

You are missing out!,"I absolutely LOVE this product! Ever since I became a licensed Esthetician I have been able to try hundreds of products and this is by far one of my favorites for a daily exfoliant. This is the older sister product compared to the Dermalogica Daily Microexfoliant. I have learned over experimenting with this product it is best if you wet your hands first before you pour a DIME size amount into your hands. Rub your hands together to create a foam like consistency. If your hands are too wet it will cause the exfoliant to become too runny. If your hands are not wet enough the product will be too thick and grainy which can cause irritation. I have acne, hormonal skin that causes me to break out a lot and this product really helps keep it at bay. I would suggest exfoliating at night and if you have active acne make sure not to scrub intensely because it will cause it to be worse or be more irritated. Also, hint hint it WILL cause your skin to feel VERY dry after because its an exfoliant (whaaaaaaat... That's crazy, I know) Make sure you apply a serum and moisturizer afterwards to put hydration back into your skin.",No,4 years ago,Indiana,5,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

My skin feels GREAT after use...but I noticed breakouts,"I received a set of dermalogica superfoliant, multi-vitamin power recovery mask and dynamic skin recovery cream from a friend as a gift. I have never used this brand before and as always, felt bit skeptical about it. In any case, I gave it a try. First I used the superfoliant which has terrible smell (not gonna lie) but that's probably b/c it is natural, without all the 'extra chemicals' so I was fine with it. My face felt super smooth and clean. I then applied the multi-vitamin recovery mask which went on smooth but then my face started to burn, really badly so I had to wash it off. I figured, ok - let me apply that recovery cream and then all heck broke loose. My skin was RED and very irritated so had to wash it all off with water which did help. I tried the multi-vitamin recovery mask on its own few other times as well as the dynamic skin recovery and unfortunately not only did it irritate my skin but I noticed break-outs. I don't remember the last time I broke out like this. Bottom line - I've read and heard great things about this brand but it really depends on your skin type and how it may react to the products.

I love this wash so much I will not be without it. I am using differen gel (sp?) and this and the other Microfoliant are gold to my skin. It's important to use a light Microfoliant when using retinal. With the comparison. I enjoy the charcoal much more. Yet I'm very upset that you can't give me more than what is provided. And I am a person that will spend that extra coin for a product that works. I use this every other day and in between their cream Microfoliant wash, when not using the enzyme wash.

Immediate results,I was exposed to this product by my aesthetician and the results are nothing short of astonishing. Each product I try seems to positively increase the quality of moisture and firmness in my skin. I tried it first as a sample and then immediately ordered from dermalogica - it's that impactful. First - be aware of the concise instructions do you do not waste it. Second - cup your wetted hand (be conservative) and then add the powder to the minimal water and then it forms a foaming paste that expands upon contact with water. If you need to add a bit more water; do so after the initial paste is made because otherwise you get a runny consistency that is more difficult to apply to your face. Third - don't forget your neck. You'll be amazed at the elimination of crepeyness and increase in smooth texture. This is similar in texture to charcoal tooth powder or a few other cleansers that come in powder form. THAT BEING SAID - this is far more effective in that it changes texture and seems to be more penetrating and effective than other fine milled powders I've tried. It's revolutionary in its form and it's even more revolutionary in its results. I follow up with dermalogica sleep cocoon at night and a few other dermalogica products for brightening and eye area. I will never be without this product. Last - i've been using this with my power effects Clarisonic for firming and it is a perfect transforming companion to that sonic cleansing method. It's great with regular cleansing or any manual or sonic brush.,Yes,5 years ago,"Denver, co",5,1,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Fresh and tight!,"I use this product every morning as part of my facial routine. I have been strictly an Arbonne product user, but I thought I would give this product a try after my exfoliator ran out and I needed something ASAP. This product looks a little messy (and can be), but it is worth it. After you apply and rinse off your skin feels tight (but not dry) and clean. I still use Arbonne after I use this super exfoliant, but I may start switching over. The only ""downside"" to the product is the trial and error of how much powder you need and if you accidentally pour too much out it's a little difficult to put everything back.",No,5 years ago,"Chula Vista, CA",0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

I love this product!,"I had been waiting until my Daily Microfoliant ran out to be able to try this. I wondered if I would like it as much as the microfoliant, and I am very happy I made the switch.

I can't say for certain it doesn't also have to do with the fact I also started using the new vitamin C boost serum at the same time, but overall I'm very happy since I started switching over to the Smart Aging line.

Best immediate transformation,"My Dermalogica aesthetician gave me a sample and I had already been wowed by their other products to the degree I've dumped my other luxury products for this line — it's a zillion times more impactful and effective. The first time I tried this powder it reminded me how much I love a fine powder to paste product and the ease with which you can use very little and be conservative with the amount you utilize. I could not believe the ceramic smoothness to my skin when I began to rinse it off. My skin felt astonishingly smooth and poreless and BABY SKIN CUSHY and plumpened. It rinses easily and has an almost foamy expanding texture to it when added to water. I purchased it immediately the next day after trying and it's probably my favorite product so far. Magical.

New favorite,"I bought this after a recommendation from the esthetician (sorry if spelled wrong) at ulta. I usually just buy drug store products but am trying to start getting better quality products for my skin. I bought the smaller bottle because i wanted to try it out before spending so much for the full size bottle. I just used it for the first time and im in love! My face had never been so smooth. I did quickly realize a difference between this and what i normally use. First of all i am used to scrubbing kind of hard when i exfoliate so thats how i started off with this product but i quickly realized i needed to be gentle when i started to feel a bit of a burning sensation. I let up on how much pressure i was applying and continued to exfoliate very gently...no more burning. I expected that since i had to be so much gentler to avoid burning, that it would not exfoliate as well...i was wrong. This made my face feel a thousand times smoother than anything I've used before. I did find it to be a little drying so i applied a moisturizer right after rinsing and drying my face. My tips to anyone using this product is to be super gentle, you dont need to put a lot of pressure to get deep exfoliation with this product...i massaged it onto my face very lightly as if i were applying moisturizer...it works well and burning can be caused by ""scrubbing"" too hard. And i recommend moisturizing right after. I think its a fantastic product and have already recommended it to my sister and sister in law.

Changed my skin for the better,"The results for me were instant and excellent. My skin was immediately so, so much smoother after the first use and continues to improve in quality the longer I use the product. The appearance of black heads and clogged looking pores has really reduced - the improvement is particularly visible around my nose where I normally have issues. I find that so long as I am stringent with using plenty of hydrating serums and moisturisers, the exfoliator does not cause my skin to dry out and hasn't lead to an eczema breakout thus far. Although I did find that I had a breakout of spots around my chin and forehead when I tried to use it daily (a common side effect of over exfoliating). I'm not sure whether I was just being too vigorous with my massaging or whether my skin is too sensitive for daily exfoliants. However, reducing usage to every second day has cleared this problem up nicely. I use it on freshly cleansed skin by carefully tipping a small amount of the charcoal coloured powder into wet hands, rubbing them together then mixes the powder into a slightly foamy paste. I then massage this in circular motions to my face, avoiding the eye area, for approximately a minute. To finish up - rinse with warm water and pat dry I'll definitely be repurchasing when this runs out (if it ever does - it is lasting for ages!).

Possibly a new staple,"I used this product after double cleansing and before moisturiser, toners and oils, really gentle for an exfoliant but left my skin felling ultra clean and purified.

I would 100% buy this product,"If you want really clear and soft skin, look no further, the daily superfoliant is what you need in your life! It is a charcoal formula which melts into a soft paste and gently exfoliates your skin. After using this my face feels like a baby's bum and my makeup looks so smooth!

My new skin must have,"I was lucky enough to be sent the daily Superfoliant to try by Influenster. As someone who loves to exfoliate as it helps keep my skin clear I was really excited to try this. And I can honestly say it hasn't left me disappointed. It's a super fine milled powder that you mix (about half a teaspoon) in the palm of your hands with water to make a smooth medium texture paste. You then gently rub the paste over your skin in circular motions. I have found that this doesn't cause my skin any irritation and I am happily able to use it daily, I think the mixture of enzymes, aha acids and charchol are the perfect combination for me and my skin care needs. My skin has been brighter, clearer and smoother since I started using this two months ago.

not worth $,"I opened this small bottle and was extremely confused at first what was going on and how I was supposed to use the product.. I either received a bottle literally more than half empty or that's how it comes? I'm really not sure because this was my first time ever trying Dermalogica. Regardless of the packaging, the dusting comes out super quick and doesn't tell you how much to mix with the water to create a paste. Even though it did feel like it got deep down into my pores to clean, I can't say that this product was very soothing, or non-irritating. My face was very dry afterwards and had just a tiny stinging sensation. My skin felt smooth afterwards, but did not lessen the look of my pores sadly.",No,5 years ago,"boston, ma",0,1,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Made my skin feel softer and smoother,I didn't realize anti-ageing products were also great for young skin! I was a bit skeptical at first after reading that it was a powerful exfoliant so I decided to use it every other day as opposed to every day(as recommended). The powder like texture was actually easier to use than I expected and it spread nicely across my face when I mixed it with warm water. The only difficulty I found was making sure all of the product was off of my face as the grainy powder sometimes got caught but that problem was soon solved after using a wipe. My skin felt much softer after using it for about a week and this is certainly going to be a key part in my skincare routine from now on!,No,5 years ago,Bournemouth,0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

My skin type is very oily however, it is super sensitive and after putting this on my skin it began to become very hot and stingy!

Great skin refresher,"I feel this product really does scrub the skin well and gets rid of any dirt and excess oil.

I'll never be without it now!,"I thought initially that this product would be a bit of a gimmick and that it'd be a pain to use and I wouldn't end up using it daily as suggested. How wrong was I? This product has changed my skin for the better and I will never ever be without it again. It is gentle on my skin and feels amazing to use. My skin is now smoother and softer than it has ever been and it has cleared up some of my under-skin bumps that I was suffering with. The product can be a little messy to use and took a while to get used to. You only need a little of the powder and mixed with some water it creates a paste. Massage into the face in circular motions for one minute and then I usually remove it with a muslin cloth and hand-hot water. It honestly feels like a pamper session each morning! I do find I can use it daily, but I know some people with more sensitive skin than myself may need to use it every other day.

Perfect for acne-prone skin.,"This product is very unique, it is a dry exfoliator that turns into a paste once added with water.

I have acne and this wasn't too heavy or abrasive for my skin, it didn't cause/irritate any further breakouts but left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. This is lovely to revive your skin at the end of the day, a good way to cleanse your skin whilst still be able to ""feel"" the product doing something. I did find that this minimised my pores and this was gentle enough for me to use everyday! Something I've never been ale to do with an exfoliant before.

The unicorn of cleaners!,"I don't love many cleansers but this is somewhat magical. It's the unicorn of cleaners. I received this product once in my libertys advent calendar (travel size) and once as a complimentary sample. You first start by pouring some powder into your hand. I'm not gonna lie, it looks like ash and first time around I didn't hold out much hope. You add a few drops of water and turn it into a grey paste. Now this is where the magic happens. It starts to foam and bubble a little and you smear it all over your face/ neck then give it a gentle massage. I add a little more water if it doesn't glide smoothly around the visage. Rub for around a minute, you'll feel the dead skin melting away, and rinse off for baby fresh skin. I'm normally very dry between my eyebrows and forehead and this really did remove the yuck and freshen my skin right up. As a bonus my moisturiser sunk in beautifully.

Really smooth & real results,"When it comes to exfoliants and chemical peels, I have tried so many which never live up to their claims. The Daily Superfoliant does exactly what it says, producing the softest, smoothest skin of your life and visibly reduces the appearance of pores and Black heads. Using this exfoliant is fairly easy, the salt shaker type packaging needs a steady hand and be careful not to use too much product as your skin might not be able to handle it. I can't quite use it daily as it dries my skin out, I have combination skin which is on the sensitive side, however 3 times a week is all I need for a visible improvement in my complexion. Friends and family have noticed and my makeup applies so well afterwards. At first I found my skin was quite sore when applying with a stinging sensation but it quickly got used to it and it's now a staple in my weekly routine. The smell is very organic, earthy with a hint of sulphur but it's not overly strong and disappears once you wash it off - it's totally worth it for silky skin believe me! Definitely tone and moisturise afterwards and if you do this each morning before you apply makeup, you will have the more flawless foundation application of your life.

Gentle but effective,I was skeptical when I first tried this as the granules felt very gentle when wet & massaged on the skin however it made my skin noticeable softer immediately.

Great Exfoliant,"I've been using the daily superfoliant for a few weeks now, and I think it's a great exfoliant. I usually tend to use acid toners rather than physical exfoliants so I was a little hesitant to try this, but when I do use it my skin feels incredibly soft afterwards. Personally for my skin it's too harsh to use everyday so I would use it about once a week instead.

Love it,"This is such a unique skincare product. I love the simple yet elegant packaging. The superfoliant powder itself is probably the most thrilling part of this. A first glance, it looks somewhat granular and slightly rough in texture, yet upon touch, the powder instantly flattens to a silky chalk like feeling. Although it looks and feels similar to a chalk powder, it surprisingly is not at all dry like a chalk powder! Even when touching it in its dry state, the powder does not feel drying! The most exciting part is adding water to the powder in the palms of your hands. The powder instantly becomes milky and extremely smooth to the touch! When used with a cleaning brush or sponge, the face wash creates a very rich and bubbly lather. However, when used only with your hands, it has less of a bubbly lather and more of a cleansing milk texture. I use it every other night to gently cleanse/exfoliate my skin. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth without feeling dry at the end. It helps maintain soft and smooth skin with light and gentle daily exfoliation. I have developed no dry flaking patches while using this product in my current routine. There has not been a time since using this face wash where I felt my skin was becoming more oily or drier. To me, this signifies that my skin's pH is balanced well. When it comes to antioxidant benefits and vitamin benefits, it can be hard to tell. However, based on my skins overall appearance and feeling, I would say this cleansing does everything it claims! My skin looks healthy, feels smooth to the touch, has less clogged pores, and overall feels great after cleansing! It really is a wonderful, gentle and non-irritating cleansing! It hasn't broken me out or caused any form of skin drying or irritation. It really is quite lovely!

A gentle exfoliant that gets the job done!,"I really have enjoyed using this product! I will start by saying that the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it just felt a little messy to me! The powder somes out pretty quickly and the paste can get a little saturated- apart from that it's easy to use! I have sensitive skin that is dry in some areas (particularly nose and chin) and this has dramatically reduced this. I don't usually like to use scrubs as often it leaves my skin feeling raw and red. This is very gentle, and left my skin feeling clean and fresh! There is no real strong smell to this product and it is super easy to wash off unlike other exfoliants.

Love it!,"my experience using it was nothing but excellent! I use it both morning and night to gently cleanse my skin. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth without feeling dry at the end. However, when it comes to its makeup removal capabilities, this is one I would recommend using it after a micellar water, cleansing oil or makeup removal wipes. This powder face wash is not powerful enough to dissolve and lift away makeup flawlessly, so it's best to use it in the evening as a second step cleanser, making sure your makeup is perfectly removed. On that note, there is no part in the claims where it was stated this product would effectively remove makeup, so this does not at all surprise me as I had no expectations for it to be able to remove makeup well.",No,5 years ago,Liverpool,0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Unique little gem,When I first used this my main concern was it making my skin worse rather than better. I rarely deviate from my normal skincare routine in the worry that my skin might breakout but with the cold giving me dry patches and rough skin I desperately needed something improve it. Instantly after washing my face with this Dermalogica Superfoliant it felt smooth and free of dry skin.

Not worth the hype - not a daily cleanser,"Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to love this guy. I've used this for a couple of months now, and it honestly is just....meh, and borderline harsh on the skin. I have oily combination skin, and I don't really have major acne, but I do have some blackheads. Since I want to prevent wrinkles while I'm still in my early 20s, I figured, why not try it? Seemed like it would be perfect for me. Nope. Despite easing this into my skincare routine, using this made my skin go through a cycle of it being too dry, then producing more natural oils, which I would then need to remove with this cleanser because it was the only thing harsh enough to get rid off, etc etc. It made me have loads of small bumps a cross my jawline and cheeks (which I almost never had).

Unfortunately I used it once and woke up with a few spots on my face so waited a week to try again, tried and the next morning woke up with a rash on my chin. I also found that as the product is dark it sunk into a few of my pores and was left with what looked like blackheads as the product is a dark powder.

MUST have for your new 2018 skin cleanse regime!,"I honestly cannot fault this product. As someone who has suffered from very vigorous acne over the years, I am very particular of what I use on my skin. Safe to say I will continue to use this as part of my facial cleansing routine as it just leaves my skin feeling smooth, refreshed and healthy. I usually cant use exfoliants on an every day basis, as they become too harsh on my skin and really aggrivate the skin. This superfoliant however exfoliates the skin beautifully, yet isnt too harsh and I can use it every morning without my skin burning or feeling as though my skins falling off! It doesnt smell of any chemicals, its simple to use - just pout a tablespoon size of the product on a wet hand and apply to a damp face in circular motions. I was lucky enough to be sent this by Influenster as part of one of their voxbox campaigns.

One of the best exfoliators I have ever used,"This is such a cool concept for a skincare product! You pour a little of the powder into wet hands and start to mix it together, making a paste. Apply it to the face in circular motions to really feel it working to clean and exfoliate the skin. Some of the particles dissolve to make the product spread over the skin and cleanse it while others seem to stay as they are to exfoliate - this works really well! When I wash this off, my skin feels really smooth and clean and it looks healthier and more glowy. Even after a couple of uses my skin texture seems to have improved and my blackheads appear reduced. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is that using this a few of days in a row really dried out my skin, so this is not a daily use product for me.

There is no unpleasant smell like you find with some other skin care products and it leaves your skin feeling much cleaner and soft without leaving your skin feeling tight.

Skin miracle in a bottle,"I am a huge fan of the Daily Microfoliant and had used that several years ago. So when I received this Superfoliant for testing I couldn't wait wait to try it. I have been using this for a few weeks now, but to be honest I notice how great it was after the first use. My skin felt and looked smooth, it also felt so incredibly squeaky clean. I use a small amount of this in the shower and apply it to my face using small circular motions and then rinse it off. I have not as yet found a product that makes me feel like it gave my skin a deep clean. The active resurfacing ingredients do actually work in smoothing the skin while the charcoal, red algae and fruit extracts ensure all the daily pollution the skin has been exposed to has been cleared out. Which is great to help prevent any signs of aging due to pollution. I would recommend this to anyone to try, you won't be disappointed.

I use every other morning and mix with my morning cleanser as so not to add an additional step to my routine. I mix together and apply then leave on for 5 mins as a flash mask before rinsing. I love that it's a very fine exfoliation, not harsh at all on the skin and so I can still use with a cleansing brush if required for deep cleansing.

Great Exfoliant!,"The Daily Superfoliant is great, as it garners results via enzyme exfoliation and chemical exfoliation. It's not a physical scrub with beads, rather a powder formula that you can make as strong or as light as you want which I appreciate. I'm not a huge fan of powder formulas but this is nice to have as an alternative to a conventional physical scrub, as this results in more of a foaming paste that I like to leave on for a few minutes. The results are definitely good and I'm left with clear and smooth skin. For those that don't like exfoliating beads, this could be a fantastic option and it is one I'd recommend as I know physical exfoliation can cause some controversy.

A great exfoliant for clearing out pores,"I've really enjoyed using this! This charcoal-based powder exfoliant is meant to smooth skin while drawing out impurities from pores. I'm not usually a fan of physical exfoliants but I'm finding this to be really gentle so far and pleasant to use as long as I don't rub too vigorously! My skin feels smooth and looks brighter after using it, and it's done a good job at clearing out clogged pores. I'm excited to see the long term results on pigmentation as it also includes AHAs too. I personally wouldn't use it daily though, I think that's too frequent and potentially harsh - perhaps every 2 or 3 days (as I use other chemical exfoliants during the week). I've given it 4 stars due to the high price which might prevent me from purchasing (especially for a wash-off product) and the fact that I think daily use could be too much for most skin types.

Left skin feeling super soft,"I liked how soft and smooth this product left my skin. However I found using it every day was unrealistic as after three days in a row my face was stinging a lot, so I swapped to every other day or every other other day depending on how my skin was at the time. I used this along side the pre cleanse balm, the gel cleanser and the smoothing cream which left my face feeling clean and soft. However I suffer from oily skin and found that this rigourous regime left my skin oilier than ever, I assume due to the constant washing which left my skin feeling it needed to replenish itself. It did solve any dry patchiness I was Suffering from; however even with this in depth skincare routine, the pores on my nose And face were left blocked still causing me to have a fortnight of terrible breakouts and visible blackheads. I think this product teamed with a different face wash to actually clear the facial pores out would be an amazing duo.",No,5 years ago,London,0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Great Skincare Product,"I really love this product, it makes my skin super smooth and really gives it a healthy glow! I like the idea of a powder exfoliant, it is something a little different to what I have tried before. The smell of the product is slightly strange, but nothing that bothered me whilst using it. Its very gentle on the skin, mine is slightly sensitive and I have had no issues using it. The only downside for me is the price - I do find it a bit on the expensive side. If it was a bit cheaper I would definitely repurchase it, but I'm not sure if I can justify £55 each time on an exfoliator!

However, I switched to using it every other day and this immediately cleared up. It's very easy to use and you don't need much of the power to cover your whole face so the product lasts for a long time!

Super soft skin,"To put this review into context, I want to add that my skin is oily but particularly dry in my T zone; I struggle with dry skin around my nose area on a daily basis and have struggled to find an exfoliant to combat it. The first time I used the product my skin became a little irritated, however I'm putting this down to the fact that I haven't used exfoliating products as part of my skincare routine for a while now. I tried it again a day later and I had no problems whatsoever. The exfoliant is super easy to use and I love how the charcoal makes it feel like a mix between a face mask and an exfoliant. The smell is quite musky but this is down to the charcoal; it wasn't unpleasant. My skin instantly felt smoother and looked brighter - something I haven't come across with any exfoliant I've used previously. I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel! Combining it with the pre-cleanse balm, cleansing gel and post-exfoliant soothing cream has made my skin look and feel better than it has in years. The best part is that the dry skin on my nose hasn't been a problem since I began using the exfoliant. I recommend using a cleanser and toner prior to exfoliation and then a good moisturise after! Also a top tip - if you don't want to get the charcoal mixture on your hands too much, you can mix the powder in the cap with a couple of drops of water and then use your fingertips to apply it to your face - works a treat! Only downside would be the smell which wasn't an issue for me but may be unusual for other people. Overall though, this is a fantastic product and I'm so happy I've finally found an exfoliant that works on my weird oily/dry skin combo! Thank you!

Some sort of magic!,This product was sent to me complimentary via Influenster and I am so glad it was! It is honestly some sort of magic! My skin is a little sensitive so I was careful at first but I needn't have worried as it is actually really soft on the skin. It has no smell really and a little goes a long way.

Great result! Great packaging for travelling!,This exfoliator is probably on the most effective yet kind-to-skin exfoliator I've tried in a long time. Living in London I need to protect my skin from polution and dirt and this superfoliant really do the job! I've seen a decrease in my black pores as well which is really nice.

Amazing,"I received a complimentary superfoliant to review, and this is my honest opinion. I have always loved dermalogica since I trained as a beauty therapist and we used dermalogica products at college. I have congestion prone skin that is managed with a dairy and meat free diet, but over the Christmas period I slacked a little and felt my skin needed a new year boost. This is very similar to the microfoliant with a fine powdery texture that lathers into a paste with water (and smells almost biscuity), but has a slight tingle to it which I assume is the water activated AHAs, I didn't find it uncomfortable though. I thought my skin looked amazing after first use, pores looked smaller and decongested, my skin was glowing and appeared more refined and smooth. I will continue to use every two to three days to acclimatise my skin but so far I am already very happy with the results. I followed up with skin smoothing cream. Dermalogica have upped their game and excelled themselves with the superfoliant, it really lives up to its name.",No,5 years ago,London,0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Complimentary product but I will be buying again!,"I was sent this product to test out and I am usually dubious when it comes to exfoliants. Because my skin is so dry I'm scared to use exfoliators, I didn't want to cause my skin to produce more and all the exfoliators I've tried in the past have been useless. But this one is something else, I think because it's a powder you mix with water it's that much finer and not so abrasive. After using this product I found my skin was a lot smoother and unlike when I normally use water on my face, it doesn't feel as dehydrated. In my complimentary set I got sent a precleanser, a cleanser, the superfoliant and a moisturiser to try out, so I switched out my normal routine and used all of these together along with my clarins oil. I was rather happy with how this left my skin feeling so I'm going to bring this into my routine but every other night, I think my skin wouldn't be able to cope with every night. Once again I was sent this free to try out but all opinions are my own and non-biased.",No,5 years ago,Surrey,0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
This WORKS,"I am usually skeptical about this sort of product and if it is really going to work and if it is really worth the price tag as its sometimes hard to part with large amounts of money for skin products that don't always make a difference. Honestly though, I am extremely happy with my Dermalogica Daily Superfoliant. The improvement in the texture of my skin was instant, my skin is insanely smooth after using this! My face feels superb, clean and fresh. I wear a lot of makeup and my skin can often be left dry and flakey, this is the answer to that and gets rid of the flakiness with ease. I worry about my skin a lot with my makeup use but feel much better now, I'm not a real sufferer of spots and only have one or two occasionally but I haven't had a single outbreak since using this. I have recommended to my sister who suffers with acne and she is currently trying it and the results are great so far.

I'm so impressed with this product!,"I have been using the Daily Superfoliant for a few weeks now and I'm so impressed with it! I only use it a few times a week, as I use a few other exfoliant products in my daily skin care regime. But I have to say, this one has the most noticeable short term effects. After the first time of using it my skin felt noticeably smoother and softer, which is great for me as I really suffer with texture. My skin also felt cleaner too! I use this in my night time routine because, even though it's very easy to use, it is a little messy! For that reason, I think I'm going to start using it in the shower instead, that way you don't have to be so careful not to get the grey foam everywhere! I really enjoy using this exfoliant, and the fact that it's not at all abrasive on the skin is a definite plus for me.

After 7 days I saw vast improvement and after 3 weeks, almost total facial clarity. Now, 6 months later, I use it once a day and haven't had to see the doctor or an aesthetician in months.

My only issue was that if you use a bit too much sometimes you get these chunky bits in the powder and they can scratch your face so you have to be careful to not pour too much out and watch out for any clumps that might catch your skin",No,5 years ago,Essex,0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
New skin! No pores!,"Having tried Dermalogica's daily microfoliant in the past where I had a reaction, I was a little apprehensive about daily superfoliant.. however, I have to say that it is absolutely brilliant - my face felt so smooth afterwards and after only two treatments, I could see visible reduction in the size of my 'blocked' pores. I have read reviews previously about a burning sensation when using the product, however, I feel as though if it is mixed with the right amount of water the concentration should be so that it is perfectly comfortable to use on the skin - yet still with an active skincare result! I only gave the product four stars because as a more sensitive user I feel as though my skin definitely needed a good moisturiser afterwards because it was slightly dry. Aside from that, I would definitely repurchase. As someone who enjoys the feeling of having a manual exfoliation - this exfoliator is perfect!

Anti-aging all rounder. 5* review,"As a thirty something year old. Skin care has come to the forefront of my daily needs. This products sale pitch touts it as being anti-aging so when this arrives in my Influenster box I couldn't wait to get it on my face. As a bit of a skincare snob, dermalogica is a brand that I am familiar with however I am usually strictly a chemical exfoliants only kind of gal so this step of my skincare routine was always met with another brand. This product promises a a kind of 2 for 1 chemical exfoliant and anti-pollutant. The resurfaced works using AHA the chemical element - this works by gently using the chemical to loosen the bonds between your skin cells causing them to slough off leaving the fresh new layer beneath shining bright. To really pack a punch this multitasking wonder wash contains a triad of anti pollutants and antioxidants. These are affective at a cellular level. The activated Binchotan charcol absorbs toxins and pollutants that breach the epidermis, these pollutants are present in our everyday environment and the fight against them is real. They cause damage and changes to your skin at a deep level. Niacinamide improves cell nourishment, vital to ensuring healthy cells and this healthy skin. Red algae repairs the protective outlayer is with Tara fruit to promote efficient repair and regeneration. As said above I was fortunate enough to receive this item free from Influenster however all options are my own. I coupled this this treatment by double cleansing initially with the precleanse balm and massage pad (see desperate review) followed by cleansing foam used with my Clarisonic for maximum efficacy. This product comes third in my daily routine using half a teaspoon of superfoliant I apply to my wet hands and massage in for 1 minuet I remove with warm water and follow with a facial massage using the dermalogica phyto replenish oil - dermalogica.

Life changing,"Before trying this product out I was in desperate need of an updated skincare routine. 'Superfoliant' is not something I had previously tried or really heard of so I was definitely sceptical. I applied this after cleansing my face and immediately noticed my skin was visibly brighter and much smoother. After continuing to use this everyday this has only improved! The cream itself smells really lovely and refreshing. I follow up with moisturising my face all over. Applying this before bed leaves me waking up with the perfect base for makeup: I have noticed it helps my makeup glide on so much better!

I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!,"So, only used this product for about a week, the first time I used it the first thing I noticed was my skin was SQUEEKY clean, it litterally squeeked. I've found that living in London has really affected my skin and made it really congested and not many exfoliates will work without being too harsh on the skin, but this.. was amazing, you can tell it's really doing it's job. I like to let my face air dry after I wash it, just to make sure there's no extra bacteria from towels ect going onto my face after I've cleaned it! Sometimes this can make the face a little dry, so maybe a mixture between the superfoliant and me letting my skin try naturally has contributed to that. So straight after I pop on my Dermalogica skin smoothing cream, which soaks in almost instantly and made my skin feel amazing aswell!!! I can't recommend these products enough!

Make sure you use your usual high SPF afterwards. I'm quite sensitive yet this has caused me no reaction. I have to mention I'm an advanced AHA and BHA user so my skin's 'used to' the exfoliants.

CAVEAT* sometimes my skin can be sensitive usually fine though anyway a few minutes after drying my face it was burning and between my nose and cheeks and my forehead was blotchy. Looks like a chemical burn. Im surprised because it has so many skin soothing ingredients.

I rinsed for at least two entire minutes, and then immediately tried a rose water spray with some cetaphil to calm my skin down.

I started getting monthly facials and Dermalogica is the brand they use so I figured I should start there. The daily microfoliant is a game changer for people who want brighter, more even tone, and smaller pores. The only negative is the smell could be better, it kinda smells like rice (which makes sense since it is rice based).

"Good ingredients, yet average results!","This contains not only 'Papain' and 'Salicylic Acid' - two of my go-to ingredients I look out for when purchasing a new exfoliator, but several other very good ones too. To say I was looking forward to using Daily Microfoliant would be an understatement. I followed the instructions and used a small amount of powder mixed with water into a paste, and then massaged over my face for 1 minute before washing off. It worked fine, no irritation or adverse effect, even a degree of 'brightening', but at the same time it did not exfoliate properly as my skin felt somewhat bumpy straight after and not as smooth as it usually does post-exfoliation. Most of my clogged pores were still clogged. For comparison I can use St Ives or most other drugstore exfoliators and get much better results, at a fraction of the price. I think this may be one of those hit and miss products.

Gentle calming exfoliator,"I was gifted this product from Dermalogica and Ulta in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed using this daily microfoliant! It's a rice based exfoliator which I found to be wonderfully gentle. The key ingredients in this product are rice, oatmeal, salicylic acid, tea tree oil and papaya enzymes. These ingredients work to brighten, calm and keep skin clear. I am actually surprised to see tea tree oil on the ingredient list because I didn't detect any tea tree scent. If you are sensitive to tea tree, keep this in mind. I've been using this for 2 days in my PM routine after cleansing my face. The product is in a powder form and I pour about a dime sized amount onto the palm of my wet hand and rub until it turns into a paste. It's so cool to see it turn from powder to a paste just by rubbing with water! Once it turns into a paste, I massage it around my face and then rinse with warm water. It feels so calming when I'm massaging the paste. The faint scent of rice and oatmeal reminds me of baby food and that sweet calming scent of a newborn baby.

Skincare staple!!,"This gently foaming micro-exfoliant is a game-changer as far as I am concerned. Disclaimer: I do not experience skin sensitivity and have combo-dry skin, which means in the winter especially if I am not vigilant with my exfoliation my skin ends up patchy, dry, tight, and peely in all the wrong spots. This physical exfoliant is the first one I've tried that is gentle enough for daily use, yet effective in keeping the dry spots and peely skin at bay without any sign of irritation or over-exfoliation, like breakouts. I love using this in the shower to really soften up any dead skin before sloughing it off with this product. It comes in dry powder form and is activated with water, which makes it TSA-friendly as well. After each use, my skin looks and feels amazingly soft. Can't say enough good things about this one! *product gifted for the purposes of review",No,1 year ago,"Washington, DC",0,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Good Alternative to Eminence,"This product had a creamy texture, quite unexpected for a microfoliant, but a pleasant surprise. I was comparing it to my usual product, Eminence Stone Crop.

I use it both morning and evening prior to my skin care. Because of its powder form, it is also ideal for travel.

Repurchase Forever,"Gifted by Dermalogica. I've purchased this item in the mini size at least 5 times now. The reason I buy a mini is because I don't want to risk not being able to take it with me when I travel! It's THAT good. I'm a sucker for a physics exfoliant, & this product is a combo of physical (rice bran) & chemical (papaya enzymes + salicylic acid) to gently exfoliate. You can add a small amount of water for a more textured paste consistency, or add more water for a thinner / more foamy texture - so a customized experience each time. My favorite hack is to add this to my favorite gentle cleanser! Overall my skin always feels smooth, soft, bright & comfortable after I use it. Never dry or tight! Which makes this a great product to use as part of makeup prep, for a smooth finish.

Since this Daily Microfoliant is literally meant to be used daily, there is no need to overdo it. GENTLY rub your face for up to 1 minute, then rinse.

Okay but not my favorite,"Dermalogica has been hit or miss for me in the past. This microfoliant would be a miss but to be fair: I don't think any company makes microfoliants well because of its nature and structure. First off, microfoliants are created to be dry and most have some sort of physical exfoliant included. What usually ends up happening is: the product dries the skin out because it's too strong OR the humidity in the bathroom ends up solidifying the product inside the bottle over time.

Potential To Be Great For Everyone,"This was the birthday gift for February and I had been wanting to try it someday anyways. This reminds me a lot of the DHC Face Wash Powder. It makes my face feel SUPER soft after I use it and it really does help to brighten and clarify. I don't use it everyday though. I use it about every two-three days. I think if it is used every day on skin that doesn't have a lot of issues at first (if you're not having a breakout, if you don't have oily skin) or if you have dry and sensitive skin, I think it could really hurt. Everyday exfoliation seems silly from what I have been told about skincare and the skin cycle. Always listen to your body.",No,2 years ago,"Madison, WI",2,1,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
This product is so good...,"I had to write about it. I dealt with a lot of facial hair and I would tweeze and pick on my face, leaving it bumpy, red and rough. I also deal with hyperpigmentation all over my face and under my chin. The issues continued even after I stopped picking my face and started laser hair removal. But my god after using this exfoliator a few times, it's like my skin changed completely! It's silky smooth and the redness is gone! I had always been embarrassed with the texture of my skin, to the point that I didn't like anyone touching me, but those insecurities are GONE. I can't stopped touching face! I have seen my hyperpigmentation lighten up, but that was after I used the product for 3 weeks and I have kept up with my weekly skin routine with other products and the fact that I've stopped picking at my skin, so I'm not sure how effective it's on discoloration. But I would recommend anyone who deals with skin issues they have because of facial hair removal, it's a lifesaver.",No,2 years ago,NC,1,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Very impressive,"I got this as my birthday gift this month because I've been in need of a good exfoliant, and I've definitely found it. Even after just the first use there was a complete difference in my skin texture. My forehead and nose have been on the rough side for a few years now, and this product makes them feel so soft and smooth. A little product goes a long way, I'd say half a dime size. If you do accidentally pour more than you meant to like I did the second time, use the excess on your chest and neck. It works on the body too! There's a very subtle scent once it's turned into a paste, but the best way I can describe it is neutral. Not good or bad. There hasn't been any irritation or any kind of negative reaction when used in combination with my current skin care routine. The price tag is daunting, but with results like mine, it's worth every penny; at least to me.

Honest Review,I got this in the travel size for free for my birthday gift and they lady behind the counter told me she swears by it (I've heard that one before though lol). I use it and my skin is super soft! I have sensitive skin so I was a little worried about it but I had NO breakouts or rashes or anything from it! It left my pores looking amazing and my face has never been less oily before in my life. I added a little bit of moisturizer ( I'm obsessed with moisturizer lol) and my skin was glowing all day and my make up went on flawlessly. I've continued to do my routine with this included and didn't have any breakouts for my period (which I normally break out). I would 10/10 recommend to anyone!

Worked from the very first use,"I received the trial size of this product as my birthday gift this month. I was very impressed and will be purchasing regularly now. I usually use Clinique products, but this was incredible so I'll definitely be holding on to this one. I have combination skin and it works well on my oily areas without over-drying the rest. I must admit that I am a little disappointed that it costs so much. My routine is as follows: 1) I start in the shower. I wash my hair and body first to give the hot water time to steam open my pores. Then I wet my face and neck and use facial soap to cleanse. 2) After rinsing the soap, I apply this product per instructions. A little goes a LONG way with this. I gently massage it onto my face and neck for about 30-45 seconds. As I do so, I can already feel my skin getting smoother and softer. I've never had a product that makes such a drastic difference, especially on the very first use. 3) Immediately after rinsing, I go ahead and get out of the shower, and dry off all of my body except my face and neck. I apply toner to my face and neck, then moisturize with Clinique products as well. The end result is softer, smoother, younger-looking and younger-feeling skin. I can't help but keep touching my face to feel how smooth it is. It feels silky soft. My husband noticed the difference after the first use and he LOVES it. I've now used it 3 times and even the most stubborn blackheads and bumps that I get on my chin are gone. Can't see them or feel them at all. I will absolutely recommend this product to others.",No,2 years ago,"Cleveland, OH",2,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Amazing at 1st try!,"I just bought the small bottle of this and tried it and wow, my face feels very smooth,soft, and not dried out. I have dry skin with redness and just using this once was amazing. I can only imagine after a few weeks of use how my face will look and feel. Trying to take care of my skin after buying a really nice Anastasia foundation but after application, my face still had flaky dry spots amd I was advised to use an exfolient to help that.

Fantastic,"I have incredibly sensitive, reactive, normal/dry skin...and I'll emphasize sensitive. It's ridiculous. I typically stay away from any form of physical exfoliation (also can't use Vitamin C, Glycolic Acid, or Benzoyl Peroxide) but I saw so many reviews on various sites about people with sensitive skin using this, so I thought I'd give it a try. We moved to a much dryer climate and my skin was actually flaking and I had to do something about it. I started with the mini size and have since bought two of the larger sizes. Make sure that you add enough water or it will feel a bit rough. I just pour a dime size amount in my palm, add a bit of water and rub my hands together and then gently rub on my face...I think the instructions say to do it for about a minute. My skin feels so soft and I have not had any bad reaction to it. I use it daily because it is so gently, but I could easily use it every other day or every couple of days.

HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT!!,"I bought this product a year and a half ago and really liked it, but when i got the clarisonic i figured that would be enough exfoliation for my acne prone, sensitive skin. I hadnt loved this product the first few times i used it, then i realized i wasnt using it right! Recently i moved to a colder climate and realized my skin had these flaky dry patches on all of my healing pimples, and the clarisonic wasnt helping. Thats when i found this in the back of my drawer and decided to try again. You're supposed to massage it on your face for a full minute so the chemical exfoliant part kicks in, which i hadnt really done the first times i did it, so when i did it for the first time recently i realized this was my new holy grail. It delivers immediate results!!! My serums and moisturizer went on so smooth and immediately absorbed into my skin, and the next day i woke up with NO dry patches for the first time in months. I was SHOCKED. I dont use it daily, maybe 3 times a week when i dont use my clarisonic, but the difference is night and day. My textures also greatly diminished and ive tried everything for acne, let me tell you. Im still on the mini but i will be purchasing the full size soon.

Also my skin is self extracting. I noticed two pimples this morning that had actually extracted themselves so I finished the rest. Now, these pimples were not on ly face before , so what's happening is the dead skin is coming off my skin which is causing impurities to come to surface.

Been using this for 2 1/2 year!,"I am not one to write reviews ( mainly because things don't work) but this has changed my life. I've been using this for two and a half year and it still works ! What I like about this is that you can use it everyday because of how light the exfoliant is. People get confused and think the hard the exfoliant the better, but that is NOT true. You are damaging the skin when you use something rough. I have acne prone skin, sensitive, redness, uneven skin tone and since I've been using this it has made my skin soft, even less red, less to NO ACNE, and brighter which is a plus.

Already Love It After 1 Week!,"I recently got a facial at the skinbar and was introduced to this product. I have been using the dermalogica brand for about 3 months and it's done wonders for my skin. I have been jumping from brands for the past 3 years with nothing working and my acne continued to get worse. After using demalogica, my cystic acne has greatly improved and I just get the occasional breakout here and there. Now, with clearer skin, I was looking for a product to help with my uneven skin due to years of acne scars. I won't say that after 1 week my scars are gone, but my skin feels amazing and I have less redness overall. If you are looking for a gentle exfoliate, I would highly recommend this!",Yes,4 years ago,"Burbank, CA",1,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
LOVE THIS,"I love this product!! It has just enough grit that I can feel it exfoliating and doing its job. But it dissolves quickly which makes it easy to rinse away! It's also gentle enough that I can use it every day and it doesn't bother my sensitive skin. The only con to me is that it's a little pricey for the average buyer, but Clearly it doesn't bother me too much, as I will continue to buy this again and again!",Yes,4 years ago,Kansas,2,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
I would buy this over and over again.,"If you are looking for a ""quick fix"" this product is not for you. This product will make your skin irritated and red, why? You ask because it's an ""EXFULIANT"" even if it is a labeled ""Microfoliant"" it's made to exfoliate the skin and will leave it red and will leave your skin dry and flaky the first couple of times. This product is for every day use to take off the dead layers of skin. If you do not want your nasty dead layers off and rather have a product keep your skin the same or slightly better THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! After you use this product make sure to use a SUPER HYDRATING lotion. I DO NOT reccoment you using makeup right after this product especially after the first couple of uses it will make your skin peel. Let your skin breathe for at least a week before applying makeup. (Makeup after your done peeling looks flawless after the use of this product for about over 2 weeks of the use of the Microfoliant)After about a week or so your skin should look and feel brand new and you should never have the skin peeling issue again. Maybe on your nose every once in a while or spots on your face. This is NORMAL because your dead skin is coming off. Every year we Shed pound of dead skin. Don't be shocked when you see it come off it's NORMAL. This product is amazing and has helped my skin (little to no acne dry skin) and my sisters skin (acne prone and combination oily) also my brother uses it when he want a good clean look (oily skin and acne prone) like I said if you want a quick fix like all the people rating this a 1 this is NOT for you.

A Wonderful Exfoliant!,"While perusing Dermalogica's wide range of products, this was always a product that I glossed over. I didn't have any interest in it, as I already had an exfoliant that I had currently been using and was fine with. It wasn't until after I had gotten at facial at Ulta by one of their skincare specialists, that I fell in love with this product. It's a very fine, powder-like consistency that, when mixed with water, turns into a paste. It's very gentle, exfoliates nicely and doesn't irritate my skin or break me out. I use it two to three times per week after cleansing. Highly recommend if you have dry, oily, combination or even sensitive skin!",No,4 years ago,Florida,1,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Wow,"This gently removes dead skin cells and impurities with each use. You can smell that it's rice-based; not a heavy scent, but a little different. That said, I'd rather have that then an artificial scent ingredient added. No lingering scent once washed off. ""Doesn't Remove Makeup"" shouldn't be an option on the CONS list. This is an exfoliant and should be used after you've cleansed your skin. I would assume that it wouldn't remove makeup, it's not supposed to. I've got very dry sensitive skin and am able to use this twice daily - it's awesome! Took a couple times to figure how much to use and how to avoid making a mess.

I'm Blown Away,"First, a little background. I have oily skin, but I also have mild seborrheic dermatitis (a form of eczema). My face is sensitive, oily, AND rough / dry simultaneously. This makes finding products difficult. I used to use St. Ives Apricot Scrub (too harsh) & Dr. Brandt's Microdermabrasion (too drying) before faithfully. This is the best exfoliant I've tried thus far. It's a powder that transforms into a scrub after wetting and rubbing your hands together. My face has never felt so smooth. It also doesn't dry my face out. I tried the mini version but I'll definitely be purchasing a full size soon. I use it once a week, but only bc I use a harsher microexfoliant once a week as well (bc of eczema).

effective gentle exfoliating,"for anyone who's skeptical of exfoliants that are too fine.... this is an exception. that was my way of thinking when I used a heavier granule exfoliator, then switched to sugar, and finally mud masks. they did the trick for a bit, but what they ultimately left me with was overworked skin. my sensitive skin just couldn't take the excessive scrubbing and drying out from the clay. a friend recommended this to me, and while I thought It'd do nothing for me, it did.

I have extremely sensitive skin but after using this microfoliant my skin is not red or irritated. I use it every night and then follow it up with a light moisturizer.

Should you buy or not? Read below...,"I have really problematic oily skin. Mini-pimples and bumps all over chin and jaw-line area. Bumps all over my cheekbone area all the way up to my temples. So far, it exfoliates well. It makes my skin look like glass skin whenever I use it. It really cleans out my texture and pores. & It makes your skin really soft after ridding all that layer of gunk! One con would be that it dries out your skin right after use but most exfoliators do anyways. Just moisturize really well right after. This bottle is huge and you don't need much for your face, so it'll last you a long, long, long time. However, I do recommend that you test it out first to see how you would like your paste to feel like on your face. Too little water will feel like sand paper on your skin, too much water and you won't get any good use out of it. Overall, I recommend it!

Reviews are Misleading!,"I got this during the most recent beauty sale; for me this was a splurge even at 50% off but I wanted something gentle to help relieve breakouts and exfoliate dry skin, and this stuff had so many great reviews with people saying it was worth every penny! I can say that after using this each time, my skin did feel very soft. It did exfoliate, but also made my skin feel tight afterward. I read reviews saying not to overuse it at first, so I started in with this twice a week for about 3 weeks. First time it seemed ok. Every time after that, I'd wake up the next morning with little pimples forming all over that weren't there the night before. They'd take a few days to go away, then I'd try using this again, same result, more breakouts to deal with the next morning.

Please Read My Review!,"I was first introduced to this product when I was in school to become an esthetician and I'm just as in love with it now as I was back then. I have dry, sensitive skin but this does not bother it at all. I was using Tatcha Rice Powder but that started making me break out in hives so I switched back to this. It evens out my skin texture, brightens, and helps control my occasional hormonal breakouts on my chin. I use it every night after I wash my face and before I apply my toner/serum/moisturizer. It's not intended to remove make up so make sure you still remove make up prior to using this. Also it does come out as a powder so some say it can be ""messy"" but you only need a little bit and that goes a long way. Make sure you add just enough water to make it a foamy paste (too little of water and its harsh on the skin; too much water and it'll just seep through your hands and down the sink). Even though I don't have oily or acne prone skin, I'd still recommend this to those who do because of the papain and salicylic acid thats in it will help you along with other products you already use. It's pricy but its worth it and the regular size bottle will last you a long time. You'll get your moneys worth. Just because you had a bad reaction doesn't mean everybody who is considering buying this product will btw. Everyones skin is different.

heaven sent!,"I never knew anything about this before getting my first facial at my local Ulta. I have used this product every single day since the day it was introduced to me and it will forever be incorporated in my skincare routine. This product has cleared up almost ALL the dark spots i used to have on the sides of my face. My skin tone is so much more clearer than it was less than 2 months ago and it just keeps getting better. I started really paying attention to my skin care routine and what i use on my face for the past 2 months and i can honestly say, when people ask me ""what did you do?!"", this product has made the biggest difference. If applied correctly, this product is not harsh on your skin at all (at least not for me). This product is not messy - you only need a little - if you feel this product is messy you're using way too much. And lastly, the price... I'll leave any one who is skeptical with this - You get what you pay for. I'm a clearance/sale girl all day don't get me wrong! But when it comes to your face and your skin in general - somethings are just worth the money. I could've EASILY gotten something different for a way cheaper price - but i highly doubt i would have the result i have today and i doubt i would see the results i have today in such short time with any other cheap product. This product can be considered pricey to some - but for these RESULTS if you ask me the price isn't enough! You will not regret.

I love all the ingredients in it and I am using it every night after I remove makeup with a face wipe and wash my face. I apply wet paste on wet face with circular motions for one minute and then allow it to dry and leave on face for 3-4 minutes (as a quickie mask to whiten) then rinse off and continue with my PM routine.

My skin has been looking pretty darn good, but this winter has brought on some texture/patchiness I was hoping to correct. After I saw so many youtube makeup artists saying it helped, I was sold. This was the only thing I changed in my skincare/makeup routine was this product. My entire face is one entire rough patch, skin is flaking off, and my makeup wouldn't apply to my face after ONE USE. It looks TERRIBLE. It's so dry/flaky that it hurts to smile. I even diluted it pretty well with water, so there was no harsh scrubbing or exfoliating.

"""Cure"" is a strong word, but...","This product is unbelievable. After years of struggling with acne, taking antibiotics, using harsh topicals, even undergoing a round of Accutane, it seemed like absolutely nothing was going to clear my skin. My forehead was greasy and bumpy with things that weren't quite blackheads or white heads while my cheeks and jaw were dry and developed deeper, bigger zits. I gave up on my dermatologist who wasn't helping and walked into Ulta. Within 2 minutes, the Dermalogica rep looked at my skin and recommended this product. I was skeptical that something that seemed so gentle could do anything, but she told me to start off using it every other day or every two days and I could potentially increase to every day use. Well, that's what I've done and seriously, my skin has never been brighter, smoother, clearer, softer, etc. This stuff is a little pricey, but it is a MIRACLE.

When I started using this (I so far used it every other day and abt 7 times), it... Got rid of the bumps, faded my dark spots, and tightened my enlarged pores. Pretty drastically, too!

Perfect for daily use,"I have super sensitive skin so I love how gentle this product is. Fragrance free was a plus to me! I worry about all the additional, unnecessary chemicals. I also tend to have very oily skin so I struggle to find something that I can use daily without over drying my skin or that isn't effective enough to prevent breakouts. I don't wear a lot of makeup but find myself trying to hide behind my foundation when I get insecure out my skin.

not sure yet...,"I think I need more time with this product, but overall I feel good about it. I have super sensitive skin and use other Dermalogica products to combat that. The daily microfoliant is very mild-it's barely abrasive. Once you wet it and rub between your hands nearly all of the grit disappears and it's pretty much just froth.

Terrible allergic outbreak on my face!,"This product made my skin break out in ted, itchy blotches on my cheeks and nose. The blotches were itchy and burned. This product needs to have a warning. It was recommended by the skin line specialist at Ulta. I will be returning the product and discussing the allergic side effects with her do she can earn further clients.

It's good but not great,"I bought this product because I wanted something more gentle to exfoliate my face with. I have combination skin and it does tend to get really dry even after I cleanse with gentle face cleansers. I first started to use this product twice or three times a week at the most and I did not notice a difference at all. Needless to say I was disappointed because so many people gave this exfoliant raving reviews. I decided to use it everyday to see if I would see a difference in my skin. I dampen my face, pour a half teaspoon on a little silicone scrublet face pad and start exfoliating. Half a teaspoon of product does go a long way and I feel like the exfoliant works better using the silicone facial pad than just your hands. After using it everyday, I can honestly say my skin does look brighter. It is gentle enough to use everyday but it can dry out your skin a bit. I like the product but I can't say that it's a miracle product or a life changing product. You will see results but perhaps not as drastic as you might think because of the raving reviews you read. I do plan on purchasing this product again for its gentleness most of all.",No,6 years ago,"Rosenberg, Tx",5,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Excellent Effective Product,I really feel I get results with this product. It is very pricey for what it is but a little goes a long way when using. I have purchased this several times now and it lasts for almost a year with regular use of 4-5 times a week. I just purchased the set of this with the precleanse oil that was available over the holidays and I keep the travel size around for trips. This gentle product leaves my skin very smooth and fresh and alleviates dry flakey patches. I prefer to use it in the morning prior to applying makeup as it makes foundation application smooth and flawless. Makes a big difference in the appearance of my makeup and brightens my complexion. I will probably try the new superfoliant as well but love how gentle and effective this product is. Never leaves my fair skin red or irritated.

Best every day exfoliant,"This is the perfect exfoliant. The price is a little out of my range for the full size - but when I can afford it, I'm getting it! I've been using this product for years and I've found deals here and there (21 days of beauty, now they offer the smaller size, etc.). But when I'm actively broken out in acne I can use this to get rid of dry skin because it has salicylic acid and even though it gets rid of all my dry skin - the exfoliation isn't at all too-abrasive so it won't just open the breakouts and spread the bacteria like most exfoliators. A life saver. It doesn't smell so good - but it's not potent at all and it's only if I'm actively trying to smell it and I'd prefer that over a fragrance that harms the skin any day. Thanks dermalogica!",Yes,6 years ago,Indianapolis,0,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

My holy grail exfoliant!,"I use this product almost every day, it's gentle enough for daily use and doesn't irritate my sensitive/acne prone skin. When I purchased this I was looking for an abrasive exfoliant, something that would get the job done. The sales rep recommended this to me because of my acne, and said that an abrasive exfoliant would just irritate my skin. I was skeptical about this product because it's ""gentle"", however when I used it I found that my acne calmed down quite a bit and I've not had any new break outs since starting to use it. The smell reminds me of Aveeno oatmeal bath, it's not the best smell but there are no added fragrances so I really like that! I would recommend this over and over again! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and ready for makeup application.",No,6 years ago,"Laurel, MD",0,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
i love dermalogica,"Honestly - dermalogica has been a total game changer. I am obsessed with their entire line. I love my esthetician at Ulta and we talked about my needs after my facial and this is something she recommended to me along with precleanse (IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS IS - YOU SHOULD BECAUSE ITS THE BEST). It's gentle and I feel like it will last me forever. The only reason I decided to write a review is after reading the con list. FIRST OFF - this is NOT a makeup remover. This is to exfoliate your skin. You should be REMOVING your makeup before you use this. If not - you're just rubbing your makeup into your pores. Also - if you don't exfoliate on a regular basis I wouldn't start using this every day. Although it's very, very gentle - so is your skin. Give your skin time to adjust and start adding this into your routine slow and be sure to follow up with a moisturizer. It is pricey but I have not found anything remotely this gentle before. To me, it's worth spending the money on this. I know it won't damage my skin and because I use it a handful of times a week it will last me forever. I also do not find it messy. You pour a little into your hand and add a little bit of water and then gently massage into your skin. I highly recommend this among a ton of other dermalogica products. It's worth the money to invest in your skin! This is a GOOD brand who doesn't add BS into their products. I will forever be obsessed.",No,6 years ago,"Long Island, NY",5,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Can't be without,"I love this exfoliant! I use it every other day, if I don't, I start feeling bumpy and flaky skin. I feel like this gently retexturizes my sensitive skin and it keeps it exfoliated.

About a year ago I started getting cystic acne along my jaw line. I tried everything to help it, and found that this is the only product that prevents it. I stopped using this product for a few weeks to see if I could go without it, and started breaking out around the 1.5 week mark, so I immediately went and purchased another bottle.

One of the few products I buy again and again!,The is one product worth the money and I always buy. One bottle goes a long way.

best gentle exfoliant,"This is my go-to skin product. Very gentle, yet very effective. I def recommend to use this product over the sink VS shower.

"Awful smell, but works great!","To be completely honest, the first thing I noticed about this product is the smell - horrible...like baby spit up. However, I highly encourage everyone to hold their breath or bear it, because it works amazing! I had problems with my makeup going on uneven & looking dry on my nose - so I immediately thought my skin was dried out or I was using the wrong makeup. It wasn't until I spoke with an aesthetician that I found out I needed to exfoliate. This stuff did the trick - my makeup goes on smoothly & my skin feels great. I love that it's gentle enough to use every day & doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. It's a bit on the expensive side, but worth every penny!",No,7 years ago,MI,1,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Love it,"I have been struggling with super dry acne prone sensitive skin. I can never seem to exfoliate enough to get flakey peeling skin off my face, even for one day. I've used this stuff twice and I noticed a difference in how my skin felt as soon as I rinsed this stuff off. The second time I used it my flakes were reduced to a fraction of what it was before. If imagine by the third usage I will see even less flakes. So far I'm very excited!",No,7 years ago,Southern Cali,1,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Amazing!!,"I bought this product after a recommendation from the esthetician at Ulta. Before using this, my face was probably at its absolute worst it's ever been. I had little bumps everywhere, mostly small, but some bigger flare-ups as well. I thought I had an major acne issue. She told me I had clogged pores after examining my skin. She recommended this for how gentle it was for my sensitive skin. I have used many acne medications, both topical and orally, and none of them worked like this. This product is amazing. It literally cleared up my face in a week and half. I still have some little bumps, which are still healing, but nothing like it was before. My skin feels smooth and clean. It has noticeably changed my skin tone. Best product ever and I will definitely be purchasing this again!!",No,7 years ago,Ohio,3,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Gentle and Effective,I use this Microfoliant once a day to clear make up and debris from my pores. I have rosacea and sensitive skin that cannot tolerate other exfoliants. Dermalogica is gentle yet effective for me. I use after cleansing and it makes my skin look brighter and my pores tighter. It prepares my face for moisturizer and my make up goes on much more smoothly.,Yes,7 years ago,Texas,1,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

This gentle exfoliant works wonders daily!,I noticed a difference almost immediately! I have clogged pores that result in little bumps under my eye area and after two uses they are all but gone. They were greatly diminished after one use. It's another step true- as you must make a paste with water in your hands - but it's so easy and the results are amazing!

Magic in a bottle,"I was directed to this product at my local Ulta. I was looking for something to help smooth, hydrate, and exfoliate my face. BUT it had to work for extremely sensitive skin.

Gentle exfoliant- leaves skin smooth & soft,"I've been using this exfoliant for a few months now. Depending on the condition of my skin I'll use it anywhere from once a week (if I'm clear) to daily (if I'm breaking out). This stuff is waay more gentle than most exfoliants which honestly I found were making my skin worse from all the harsh abrasives. This microfoliant does none of that- it exfoliates smoothly and gently as often as you need without being harsh or feeling like it's stripping your skin... After I use it my skin feels smooth/soft/calm never irritated/tight/dry.. I'm not a huge fan of the smell (it's not bad, just not great) or the price, but the stuff does last forever and does exactly what it claims so I can't be too mad about that!",No,7 years ago,"Humboldt, CA",1,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Ehhh...,This product was useless for me. I should've known an exfoliant I can use daily would be too gentle for me. I didn't see any worthy results... It was very costly for the results to be unnoticeable. I gave it to a friend to see if it worked out for her.
